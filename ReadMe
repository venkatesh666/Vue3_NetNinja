directives used
v-on:click
instead of v- we can use"@"
using v-if
v-if loads from js. The element is removed when false. More expensive because it manipulates DOM
v-show loads from css. The element is hidden in this. Easy because it just hides and unhides unlike v-if
v-on:mouseover which is same as @mouseover
